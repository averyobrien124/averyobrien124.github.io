<h1>Avery O'Brien</h1>

<h2>Hello world. Welcome to my page.</h2>



<p>My name is Avery O'Brien, and I am from Greenwich, CT. I am a junior at St. Andrew's School. I just started learning about computer science in CS1 class, so this is my first page.<p>

<p>In my computer science class, we were assigned groups, and I am in the Ellis group. Here is the link to the wikipedia page about Clarence Ellis:

Ellis was the first African-American to get a PhD in computer science.<p>
